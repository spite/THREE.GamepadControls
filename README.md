# THREE.GamepadControls
Camera controls for three.js using the Gamepad API

You'll need a browser that can run WebGL and the Gamepad API.

The left pad controls the camera look around, the right pad controls the movement in the XZ plane. The bottom shoulder buttons control vertical movement in the Y axis.

Not sure if the Gamepad API is working? Check [Jumping the Hurdles with the Gamepad API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/doodles/gamepad/) at HTML5Rocks and try the [Tester](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/doodles/gamepad/gamepad-tester/tester.html)

For some reason, it's only working on Chrome. Firefox and Opera have support, but the Gamepads are not being listed. Safari doesn't have support. I haven't tried Edge yet.
